# Bread Making App

This App will be for android and ios as well if we can!

The aim of this app is to produce a bread makers app with key timings and notifications.

The core recipie is in assets/steps.json. The timings of the steps with ingredients are specified.

This APP must
- Produce an alarm when a step is due. The alarm will keep ringing util the user dismisses.
- Let users rescale the n_loaves option for their cook. By default this equals 2.
- When the user is in the App they can see a cool progress timer icon for each of the timers.
- The user is able to scroll through the the steps, even to past and future steps.
